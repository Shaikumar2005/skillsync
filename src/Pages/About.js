      <p>
        I’m <strong>Shai Kumar R</strong>, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at <strong>R.M.K. Engineering College</strong>, with an expected graduation in May 2026. I am passionate about technology, design, and problem-solving. My journey has been all about bridging the gap between ideas and implementation using both code and creativity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, I have built and contributed to several impactful projects like a <strong>Human Tracking Bot using Sensor Fusion</strong> and a full-fledged <strong>Student Inventory Management System</strong>. I am also developing a full-stack project called <strong>SkillSync</strong>, a centralized academic dashboard for students to manage their learning credentials.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve actively participated in <strong>hackathons</strong>, won prizes in competitive coding and design events, and even published <strong>research papers</strong> and published a <strong>patent</strong>. I consistently push myself to stay ahead in the game by completing certifications in <strong>Cloud Computing, SQL, and UX/UI Design</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My design thinking skills are sharpened through tools like <strong>Figma</strong>, and I’ve conducted knowledge-sharing sessions on UI/UX design and frontend tools. I'm continuously learning and experimenting with <strong>React.js, Java, Python, C/C++, and MongoDB</strong>, building my technical stack.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in learning by doing, and I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate, build, and innovate. Let’s connect and grow together!
